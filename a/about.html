            Graphic design is one creative skill I enjoy doing. I believe in
            interpreting ideas through graphics or art. My skills are focused on
            Logos, Banners, Brand Identity, Packaging, Photo manipulation,
            illustration and Book designs. In my over seven years career as a
            freelance graphic designer I have worked pretty much everywhere
            (Germany, Ireland, England, Canada, Nigeria, Ghana, USA), every
            single one of these experiences shaped me as a creative person. My
            style is best described as liquid which flows perfectly into the old
            school and modern design trends. For a client, I feel graphic design
            is about communication, while the self initiated designs are about
            expression and impulses. The integration of intuition in my work is
            one which has become increasingly significant to me in recent years.
            The ability to reinvent myself from time to time is of high
            importance, when the need for change is there I want to act upon it.
            Freedom is the most important element in my life.
